# Restaurant-Reservation-and-Point-of-Sale-System

Hello! We are [Ong Chun Guan Marcus](https://github.com/MarcusOCG), [Ryan Taw Lin Heng](https://github.com/Ryancodeshard), [Rizwan Nusrath Fathima](https://github.com/fath3725), [Nguyen Vinh Quang](https://github.com/quangnd123), [Sim Kwan Hong Davis](https://github.com/DavisSim) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). We were tasked to make a Restaurant Reservation and Point of Sale System (RRPSS) Application as part of our coursework for the module CZ2002: Object Oriented Programming.

### Quick Summary Of The App
The app serves this 10 main functions
  1. Create/Update/Remove menu item
  2. Create/Update/Remove promotion
  3. Create order
  4. View order
  5. Add/Remove order item/s to/from order
  6. Create reservation booking
  7. Check/Remove reservation booking
  8. Check table availability
  9. Print order invoice
  10. Print sale revenue report by period (eg day or month)

When using the app for the first time, the restaurant has to be set up. So, number of tables available and their pax, staff and their roles and menu items need to be added before it is ready to use.
